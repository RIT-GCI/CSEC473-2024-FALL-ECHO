            <h2>I think I saw a murder last night.</h2>
            <p> I woke up last night to the faint sound of a party outside my window. When I went to investigate sure enough a group of kids had started a rager.</p>
            <p> I debated calling the cops but decided I'd let them have there fun, until. I saw a light on upstairs in the study it wasn't a steady light though more like from a flashlight.</p>
            <p> I couldn't make it out completely but I know for sure I saw someone with a knife stabbing down on another person! Like something straight out of a horror movie.</p>
            <p> I tried to chalk it up to a bad dream but when I heard about the murder on the news I knew it was real. They haven't disclosed who the killer was but it was definitely a red teamer.</p>
