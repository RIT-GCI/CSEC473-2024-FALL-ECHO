Eulogy for John “Haunted House” Scarington

Ladies and gentlemen, friends, family, and accidental party crashers,

We gather here today not just to mourn the loss of John “Haunted House” Scarington but to celebrate the life of a man who was, in every sense, larger than life—and, to some, eerily like death. John was an enigma. He lived alone, in a house that even the boldest trick-or-treaters wouldn’t dare approach. But those of us who knew him knew that behind the creaky floorboards, dimly lit hallways, and spooky exterior, John was not just a ghost in waiting—he was a warm soul. A bit odd, yes. But wonderfully, irreversibly odd.

John’s love for haunted houses began when he was just a kid. While other kids were scared of monsters under their beds, John invited those monsters to dinner. And as the years passed, he became known for it—crafting one of the most infamous haunted houses in the state, where jump scares were timed to perfection, fake cobwebs draped every corner, and every skeleton told a story. But John wasn’t just scaring people for fun; he was reminding them that fear could be thrilling. He believed that when we laugh after we scream, we remind ourselves that even in the most frightening of times, we can find joy.

He was a man who never shied away from the strange or the spooky. Many said he lived in his own world, but John would probably say that our world was the odd one. He embraced life on his own terms—throwing a party for one in a dusty mansion, surrounding himself with relics from the weird and whimsical corners of the world. And while he may not have been a regular guest at the town’s block parties, those who crossed his path found themselves oddly drawn to his charm.

It’s a strange kind of irony, isn’t it? A man who spent his life making sure people felt alive, even for a moment, was taken from us in such a chaotic and accidental way—by a party he never intended to host. The Red Team didn’t mean him harm; they were just looking for a good time, like John might have done in his own peculiar way. He probably would’ve chuckled at the absurdity of it all.

I like to think that wherever John is now—whether it’s in some great cosmic mansion or drifting through the very walls of his old estate—he’s smiling. Maybe even throwing a little afterlife shindig of his own. And I hope that when we think of him, we don’t just remember the eerie atmosphere of his home or the thrill of a well-timed jump scare. I hope we remember his kindness, his humor, and his unique ability to remind us that life, no matter how spooky, is worth celebrating.

John Scarington was never one to follow convention. While others pursued the nine-to-five grind, John decided that life was too short—and far too boring—to spend it doing anything ordinary. He turned his home into an experience, an annual pilgrimage for thrill-seekers during the Halloween season, complete with fog machines, hidden trap doors, and unsettling mannequins that always seemed to be watching. To John, fear wasn’t just a sensation—it was an art form, a way of keeping people awake, alert, and, in his words, “on their toes.” In that sense, John wasn’t just a master of fright; he was a curator of curiosity.

Yet, despite the eerie theatrics, John was a surprisingly gentle man. He was the type to listen more than he spoke, and when he did speak, it was with a slow, deliberate cadence—as if every word had been selected from some secret library of wisdom. John gave sound advice, though you might have had to wait through an extended metaphor about ghosts, shadows, or haunted attics to get to it. He believed that people wore masks every day, not just on Halloween, and it was our job to unmask ourselves by embracing what makes us weird and wonderful.

Though he lived alone, John valued connection in his own peculiar way. He kept up with old friends by sending them mysterious postcards, often without any return address, just a strange riddle or cryptic message. It was his way of saying, "I’m still here—somewhere." He loved watching horror movies with the neighborhood kids who dared to venture into his home, gleefully pointing out the clichés before they happened. Even in his isolation, John found ways to keep people close, quietly offering them joy, wrapped in mystery.

Of course, not everyone understood John. Some found his fascination with the macabre unsettling; others thought he was just plain weird. But John didn’t care about being understood—he cared about being authentic. And that was his gift to those around him: the quiet permission to embrace their oddities without apology. If you ever met him, you were likely changed in some small but meaningful way—whether by his odd jokes, his unshakable calm, or the way he made life's uncertainties seem just a little more manageable, like the slow descent of a roller coaster before the big drop.

So as we say goodbye today, let’s do it in a way John would have appreciated: without fear, without pretense, and maybe with a little bit of mischief. Life is strange, messy, and often unpredictable. But if John taught us anything, it’s that we shouldn’t wait for Halloween to embrace the unexpected. After all, it’s the twists and turns that make the ride worthwhile. And somewhere, in the dim corners of his beloved haunted house, I believe John’s spirit still lingers—not as a ghost to scare us, but as a reminder that we are never truly alone, even in life’s strangest moments.

John’s life was like the haunted house he built: strange, winding, sometimes unsettling, but always full of surprises. To step into his world was to accept that things weren’t always what they seemed—and that was the point. He wanted people to embrace the thrill of the unknown, to understand that fear and joy aren’t opposites, but two sides of the same coin. In his own way, John was a philosopher of the uncanny, teaching anyone who crossed his path that it’s okay not to have all the answers—and that sometimes, it’s better that way.

Despite his love for all things eerie, John was deeply rooted in kindness. He often left little treats on the porches of his neighbors—oddly shaped chocolates or jars labeled "Mystery Jam"—with no note other than “Happy Haunting!” Though he seemed to relish his reputation as the local oddball, those who knew him best could tell you that behind his spooky persona was someone who cared deeply for the people around him, even if he didn’t always say it aloud.

While I may not undertstand the meaning, his final words that we know of contained the phrase: FLAG<DAMN_THOSE_REDTEAMERS>. Truly a genius in his own right.

John had a knack for creating memories that people wouldn’t forget—whether it was hosting the creepiest Halloween tours, building elaborate pranks, or simply offering profound advice in his usual cryptic fashion. And now, even in his passing, he leaves us with one final mystery. We’ll never truly know how he spent his last hours in that house, or what thoughts crossed his mind as the night unfolded. Perhaps he was exactly where he wanted to be—alone, surrounded by the things he loved most, with one last story to tell.

His death, while tragic, seems fitting in a strange way—one last twist in the narrative of a man whose entire life was about surprises. The irony isn’t lost on us: a party he didn’t know about became his final send-off, and the very thing he lived for—creating spooky chaos—was what ultimately surrounded his final moments. Somehow, I think John would appreciate the absurdity of it all. Life, after all, was just one big haunted house to him—a labyrinth of the unexpected, with both terrifying and joyful moments waiting around every corner.

John’s sense of humor was as peculiar as it was brilliant. He was the type of guy who’d install a fake trapdoor in his living room just to watch visitors nervously avoid it—only to later reveal it was just painted on the floor. His pranks were never malicious; they were his way of reminding people not to take life too seriously. “The biggest scares,” he once said, “come from your own imagination. So you might as well laugh at them.” Even in the moments that felt most uncertain, John had a way of making fear seem like a companion, not an enemy.

He was also a man of surprising traditions. Every year, he’d sit down to write a letter to himself—reflecting on the fears he’d conquered and the ones that still haunted him. It was his way of staying connected to himself, making peace with the things that scared him. We found some of those letters in his office—beautiful, strange musings about life, death, and the spaces in between. In one letter, he wrote, “I think people fear ghosts because they remind us how fragile we are. But I think ghosts exist to remind us we’re not alone in that fragility.”

Though John wasn’t one to chase fame or recognition, he had a way of leaving his mark on people. A few neighbors told us that John was the first person to talk to them when they moved into town, leaving odd but thoughtful housewarming gifts on their doorstep—a tiny gargoyle, a candle that smelled like old books, or a wind-up toy bat. He didn’t need to be flashy or loud to be memorable. He just showed up in unexpected ways, quietly teaching people that small, strange gestures often leave the biggest impact.

And, of course, we can't forget John’s love for Halloween. It was more than just a holiday for him—it was his favorite time of year, when the world finally felt like it was playing by his rules. For John, Halloween wasn’t about costumes or candy; it was about the freedom to explore what scares us and find joy in it. Every creaky door, every eerie sound, and every shadow that flickered in his haunted house wasn’t just a trick—it was a reminder that fear could be fun, even beautiful, if we let it.

In the end, John’s life was a story with no clear beginning, middle, or end—just like the best haunted houses, where every turn leads to another surprise, and every scare is followed by laughter. Though his story here has come to a close, I believe he’s still with us, in the whispers of the wind through old houses, in the flicker of jack-o’-lanterns on cold autumn nights, and in every heart that dares to embrace the strange and the unknown. So let’s not say goodbye. Let’s say, “See you around, John”—because something tells me he’s not done making us jump just yet.

As we leave today, let’s not be weighed down by sadness. Instead, let’s honor John’s memory by embracing the weird, the strange, and the unpredictable. Go to a haunted house. Play a prank on someone, but do it with love. Don’t just avoid the things that scare you—chase them, laugh at them, and live fully in the moment. That’s what John did every day of his life. And if there’s any message he’d want us to take from his story, it’s this: Even in the darkest rooms, there’s always a light switch somewhere—if you’re brave enough to find it.

Rest easy, John, wherever you may be. Or don’t. Knowing you, you’d probably rather stir up a little trouble. And we wouldn’t want it any other way.
