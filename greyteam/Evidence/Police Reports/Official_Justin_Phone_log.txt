Justin: "I'm recording this just in case I die down here, I can't find my way out of the basement and it's way too scary in here. Jacob and the two Gavins were acting strange earlier, like they were scheming or something. I don't want to snitch or anything like that but just in case something bad goes down I gotta say something on here. It could be nothing, everyone's had a few drinks already and people are acting strange in lots of ways but this feels different somehow."
