Arianna S.: "Ok look, yes I was in the office where he was killed but I was just eating candy and looking for spare change or maybe some secret haunted artifacts or something, I didn't even see the dude in there!"

Officer REDACTED: "Was there anyone else there with you?"

Arianna S.: "Yeah Harrison was there too, but no murdering was done in that room while we were in there I swear"

Officer REDACTED: "We found a gun in the office where John was murdered, but haven't been able to identify the owner, do you know anything about that?"
