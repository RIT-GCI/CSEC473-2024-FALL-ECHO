Officer REDACTED: "Tell me everything that happened at this party last night."

Joseph C.: "First I checked out the basement, but it was pretty spooky down there and as I was getting out of there I think I dropped my phone, there's some good evidence on there for you guys for sure. After that I was just chilling in the murder weapon storage room with Rachel, I know that sounds bad but it's a haunted house they gotta keep them somewhere right? We were messing with some of the big ass knives in there and I got a nasty gash on my arm, got my shirt all bloody and had to leave to change. Pretty lame night honestly."

Officer REDACTED: "Would you consent to the contents of your phone being admitted into evidence?"

Joseph C.: "Sure man, why not."
